# Protsaahana-NGO-for-women
An NGO website for empowering and providing a platform for working underprivileged women.

## Our Goal
In this nation, there are a lot of talented and skilled ladies. However, they are constrained for a number of reasons, among which is a lack of market awareness and outreach. Women therefore lack the opportunities to participate in decisions regarding generating revenue and taking care of the family, although having the potential to contribute to household finances. 

Here is protasaahan, a platform that offers these underprivileged women connections they have never had before. We assist them in connecting with our NGO so they may sell their goods directly to customers without having to deal with mediators. Additionally, customers can raise funds through the website to support these ladies. And be benefited from purchasing "handcrafted things" at a fair price as well.
